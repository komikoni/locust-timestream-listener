# locust-timestream-boilerplate

LocustIO base project with a custom timestream listener.

## Instructions

### Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

__for linux and mac__

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

__for windows__

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execute the script

```bash
locust
```

The before command utilizes the `locust.conf` file to determine the test file and test execution configuration (i.e. url, number or users, etc).

## Timestream with Grafana

We have included a `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used to spin a reporting setup in case you don't have one.

(Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed and just run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Configuration

Once grafana is running (by default on port: 3000) `https://localhost:3000` , you need to:

* Connect to timestream as the datasource:
  * Host: https://timestream:8086
  * User: admin
  * Password: pass

* Import a new dashboard. We have provided a custom dashboard for you `locust-grafana-dashboard.json` that just works out of the box with the locust-events that the listener will emmit.
